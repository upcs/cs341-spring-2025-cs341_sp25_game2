## BADGES
Code coverage: 46.7% (estimated directly by the CS341Game2 team as regular code coverage estimation is not implemented in Godot's testing framework yet and we are not using json).

### HOW WE ESTIMATED
- Summed the total lines of code the team has written. This total excludes test code and code automatically written by the Godot system. (383 lines)
- Summed the total lines of our own code that the test files called. (179 lines)
- Divided the total code called by tests by the total lines of code we wrote.

### CAVEATS
- Scripts excluded from total lines of code sum: shiley.gd, scene.gd, josh_map_5+7.gd, bc_interior.gd, enemy.gd, and global.gd; this is because they are based on functions automatically written into Godot.
- Need testing: inside_db.gd and start.gd
