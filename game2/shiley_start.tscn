The Shiley School of Engineering at the University of Portland was established in 1989. 
It became the Engineering Building in the early 2000s and was renamed 
the Shiley School of Engineering in 2001, following a generous donation from alumnus Donald Shiley, who attended UP. In this map, we feature a mini-game that represents each of the four engineering majors, where players must battle through challenges to reach the end"
